This repo contains the project folder, a step-by-step guide and a (somewhat useful but ugly) infographic on how to set up the LSV cluster and how to submit jobs there using HTCondor.

Please take a look at the infographic 'lsv_cluster_nodes_structure.png' and read the step-by-step guide 'cluster_how_to.txt' in /sopro25 and follow the steps outlined there.

In case you need any assistance, don't hesitate to contact me, I'll do my best to help you.
