This repo contains the project folder, a step-by-step guide and a (somewhat useful but ugly) infographic on how to set up the LSV cluster and how to submit jobs there using HTCondor.

Please download the project folder '/sopro25' to your machine, take a look at the infographic 'lsv_cluster_nodes_structure.png' and read the step-by-step guide 'cluster_how_to.txt' (both in '/sopro25') and follow the steps outlined there.

You can also read the pdf print version of the guide, if that's more easily readable to you.

In case you need any assistance, don't hesitate to contact me, I'll do my best to help you.
